# List of Examples
Below is the list of examples, sorted from least to most complex.

## solar
This scene consists of 3 balls:
- One is yellow which represents the sun. This has a large weight.
- One is red which represents mercury. This has a tiny weight.
- One is green which represents earth. This has a medium weight.

The yellow ball should oscillate around the centre of the scene.

## rot_test
This scene consists of a set of cubes that rotate around a different axis at different speeds.

## spaceballs
This scene consists of 3 balls, red, green, and blue that attract one another.
They all have different initial velocities.

## balls
This scene consists of 4 planes that are rotated inwards to form a simple cone.
There are also balls that are generated at the top of the screen that fall down into the cone.
This shows the physics collision aspect of the system.

## phong
This scene consists of some textured cubes, a textured plane and a sphere, lit up by a light in the centre of the scene.

This is to show the phong shading that is implemented.

## tables
This is basically an entity test scene, testing how entities interact with themselves and other objects.
